HDR Camera midterm

This is a HDR Camera android application using the exposure fusion algorithm. 
The exposure fusion algorithm was developed by Tom Mertens, Jan Kautz, Frank Van Reeth from Hasselt University and University College London.  
Here is a link to their paper.

This camera takes the same image 3 times with different exposure levels. Then it merges the desirable parts of each image to form an HDR image.
